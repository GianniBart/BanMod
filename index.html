      <h3 id="information">Information</h3>
      <p>
        BanMod was created primarily to prevent "toxic" players from rejoining
        after the official Among Us ban.<br />
        Unfortunately, the official Among Us ban wasn't enough and can be
        circumvented by changing the device's IP address or using a VPN!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Gradually, the mod has become increasingly complex and many more
        features have been added, always striving to keep it compatible with the
        official servers. For this reason, it has some limitations and
        annoyances (such as waiting to send messages).
      </p>

        <li>
          There are also some role enhancements or additions to Crewmates:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Crewmate who completes all tasks in the shortest time will
              become immortal and cannot be killed or voted on normally, but can
              be voted on and killed in meetings. The Engineer and the Guesser
              cannot become immortal.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Imposter (only the Spectre) can kill the Immortal in meetings
              by guessing who they are, but if they guess incorrectly, they
              commit suicide.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Engineer, when he completes all tasks, resolves active sabotage
              a set number of times by trapdooring (coms cannot be repaired).
            </li>
            <li>
              The Guesser can kill Impostors in meetings by guessing who they
              are. If they guess incorrectly, they commit suicide.
            </li>
            <li>
              The President (exiler) can forcefully expel (or kill) a player of
              his choice. If the target is not an impostor, there are no
              consequences. Crewmates and impostors can become President.
            </li>
            <li>The Scientist will receive the actual time of the players' death.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
